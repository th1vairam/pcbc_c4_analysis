Get the count matrix.

```{r getcountmat}
countMatFile <- synGet("syn3164570")
countMat <- read.delim(countMatFile@filePath, row.names="Geneid", check.names=FALSE)
countMat <- as.matrix(countMat)
```

## Metadata

Get the metadata from the table.
Currently, there is an issue with duplicate records in the sample processing metadata table which is propagated via a join to the RNASeq metadata table. As long as columns being used are related to the cell line and NOT the biological sample, applying a unique filter as below is sufficient.

Lines failing QC are removed (using `pass_qc`), and lines annotated as being 'bad' for some other reason as well (using `bad_lines`). Only samples that are present in the count matrix and the metadata are included; some are likely missing and need to be added.

```{r getmetadata, echo=TRUE}
metadataTable <- synGet("syn3156503")

colsToUse <- c("UID", "C4_Cell_Line_ID", "bad_lines", "pass_qc", "SampleType", "Cell_Type", "Cell_Line_Type", 
               "Cell_Type_of_Origin", "Cell_Line_of_Origin", "Tissue_of_Origin", "Reprogramming_Vector_Type",
               "Reprogramming_Gene_Combination", "C4_Karyotype_Result", "High_Confidence_Donor_ID")
q <- sprintf("SELECT * FROM %s", metadataTable@properties$id)

metadata <- synTableQuery(q)@values

## Remove fail qc and bad lines
metadataFinal <- filter(metadata, !bad_lines, pass_qc, UID %in% colnames(countMat))

## Because of metadata problems in the sample processing table, there are duplicates.
metadataFinal <- metadataFinal %>% select(one_of(colsToUse)) %>% distinct

rownames(metadataFinal) <- metadataFinal$UID
```

## Process the data

Reorder the count matrix to be in the order of the metadata.
Filter based on simple threshold of counts per million (CPM).

```{r filtercountmat}
countMat <- countMat[, metadataFinal$UID]

count.nlib <- 2
count.thresh <- 10

isExpressed <- rowSums(cpm(countMat) > count.thresh) >= count.nlib
countMat <- countMat[isExpressed, ]

```

`r nrow(countMat)` genes have at least `r count.nlib` libraries with CPM >= `r count.thresh`.

## edgeR/voom/limma

Create a `DGEList` object from `edgeR`.

```{r createdge}
dge <- DGEList(counts=countMat)
dge <- calcNormFactors(dge)
```

Update the sample info.

```{r addsampleinfo}
dge$samples <- cbind(dge$samples, metadataFinal)
```

Run voom with no design matrix.

```{r voom}
cpmMat <- voom(dge)
```
